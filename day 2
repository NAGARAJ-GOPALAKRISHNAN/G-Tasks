difference between document and window objects.

Ah, diving into the world of web development! The Document and Window objects are like dynamic duos in the browser environment. 
The Document object represents the web page itself, while the Window object is like the browser window or tab that contains the Document.
Think of it this way: the Document is the content of the page—HTML, elements, all that good stuff—while the Window is the container that holds it, 
providing the environment for JavaScript to interact with the page. The Window object also includes things like the location of the page, navigation, and methods for opening/closing tabs.
So, in a nutshell, Document is about what's in the page, and Window is about the environment that surrounds and controls the page. They work hand in hand to make your web experience happen.
